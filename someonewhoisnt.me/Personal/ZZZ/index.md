_Occasionally I will report on my dreams here. This is mainly so that I can look back on them later, but I suspect others may find mild amusement from this window into my subconscious._

# *Halfway to Cotton Hill* —  _19 July 2022_

I'm homeless and taking a bus. A fellow passenger begins telling me about how he enjoys sawing people's legs off. He has tally marks tattooed below his eye which correspond with the number of legs he has taken so far. I am offered $700 for my leg. As I'm debating it, the man next to me volunteers his leg for free and seems amused with the general concept. Trying to further sell me on giving up mine, the fellow with the leg-sawing obsession hands me his saw and tells me to give it a go myself on the gentleman next to me. My reluctance wanes a bit when the fellow reaffirms his willingness to undergo this procedure, so I begin sawing at the shin, slightly beneath the knee, so as to leave him with decent prosthetic choices in the future. After struggling for a bit, I nearly hand the saw back to the man who initiated this discussion, however, I power through and manage to get all the way through. The man who I just amputated seems to be pleased with this novel experience. 

Now the focus is back to me. $700 is decent money, and after seeing the satisfied face adjacent to me, I am more willing to give it a shot. I make the stipulation that if I were to agree, the cut would need to be made in the same spot I cut, again, hoping to preserve my future options. He reluctantly agrees to only taking this reduced portion of my leg, and so, we have a deal. The actual process isn't as unbearable as I'd expect, and I did get the impression that this was a skilled and experienced man. I am given my $700, primarily in 2 dollar bills, and we both walked away (well, more of a hobble for me) somewhat content. 

Cut to a few days later, I now have a red wooden prosthetic that I am slowly adjusting to. I show it to my mother and she is not a fan. I start to second-guess myself a bit when I remember that amputees, counter to most intuition, actually require a greater calorie intake than the rest of the population, and I realize that I will probably spend much more than $700 on additional food in the future. Eventually, in order to reconcile with this dilemma, I resign to the idea that I'll just make this whole amputation ordeal out to be worse than it was for me, in the hope of potentially offsetting some of that additional nutritional cost with pity money. I learn to dress around this shitty red prosthetic by wearing matching torn red jeans that complement it quite nicely. Ultimately, I get used to it. 

# *Awaiting Confirmations* —  _17 May 2022_

I'm in a cafeteria of sorts ordering food. One of the people working there offers me a "pretzel" that they "fucked up." It is just uncooked dough. I accept, but get charged the normal price for a pretzel anyway. I panic because I cannot afford it. Instead of just telling them I don't want it, I hold up the line scrambling on my phone trying to trade Monero for something I can spend with my Coinbase card. Everyone behind me is getting increasingly pissed. 

The transaction eventually goes through and I am finally able to consume a lump of raw dough in a room full of people who hate me. I am content. 

# *Queen's Gambit* —  _13 May 2022_

A young round-faced girl with straight black hair enters my dream. Her name is Caroline, and she's a chess prodigy with a reputation for having psychic powers of some kind.

I walk into a claustrophobic concrete room, sit down at a tiny wooden table with a board across from her, and silently play d4. She plays d5 without blinking or breaking eye contact. 

I’m about to play c4 when she states: “You’re a lot simpler than most people think.” I pause and tilt my head at her, as if to inquire further, and she immediately takes my cue.

“Think about everyone you personally respect as a genius, everyone you look up to, everyone you love or are drawn to in some way, everyone you see any value in - whether you ultimately think they’re right or wrong. There’s a common thread.” 

Within a second or two, I, almost lazily,  come to a simple approximation. This time, we speak in perfect unison. 

“They all laugh at weird shit.” 

I jolt awake.
