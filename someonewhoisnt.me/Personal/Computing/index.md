# No Compromises

On my laptops I tend to try and remain principled in how I do my computing, an exercise in moderation which I feel increasingly improves my digital health. 
My primary machine is a ThinkPad X230 which has undergone many modifications to suit my wants/needs. X220 keyboard, removed battery 
and wifi card whitelists, coreboot, me\_cleaner, an added external antenna, BGA-rework to accomodate an i7-3615QE, and more. It is the best balance I 
can find that prioritizes both free-software and computing power.

I run OpenBSD, typically snapshots on this primary machine.

# Moderate Compromises

For more intensive workloads primarily revolving around my /3/-related interests and my occassional (regrettable) urge to play games,
I have a desktop with a stolen Threadripper 3960X running Gentoo Linux. Lately, this $1400 CPU has been put to great use passively mining
futureless altcoins and collecting tripcodes.

I am partial to keyboards which allow me to write my own firmware in C using QMK, the OLKB Planck being my current favorite due to the many whimsical noises it can make using the built-in speaker.
