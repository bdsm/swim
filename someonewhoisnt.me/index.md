"_A society of free people will always have crime, violence and social disruption. It will never be completely safe. The alternative is a police state. A police state can give you safe streets, but only at the price of your human spirit. [...] I am a sovereign state, and I feel that my borders are far more sacred than the politically drawn boundaries of any country._"
