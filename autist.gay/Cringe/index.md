# Fuck you and die

Here's the zone where I blatantly follow the formula of every werc site that's been created since cat-v without really doing anything new or interesting. Although, this won't remain specific to software and will grow to encompass all of my hot takes. 

I do not consider myself entirely above all cringe listed, however, I still have ideals.
